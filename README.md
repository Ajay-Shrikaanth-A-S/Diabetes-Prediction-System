# Diabetes Prediction System

The Diabetes Prediction Model is a machine learning project designed to predict whether a person has diabetes based on user-provided inputs. The model was trained on a dataset of medical parameters and features relevant to diabetes diagnosis. After training, the model was saved using the pickle library for easy deployment. A basic web application was developed using Streamlit, allowing users to input their health data interactively. Based on the inputs, the model predicts and classifies the user as either "normal" or "diseased." This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in healthcare and provides a user-friendly interface for real-time diabetes risk assessment.
